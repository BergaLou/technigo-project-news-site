# News Site

\*\* Brief description of the assignment \*\*

The goal of this project was to create a news website where the user can consume content by swiping instead of scrolling, similar to flipping through a book or a magazine. At the same time, I wanted the website to have a meaningful purpose and contribute something positive to society. Therefore, I chose to focus on news and information about animals, where users can read about current events and also find opportunities for volunteering, adoption, or traveling while helping animals in need.

\*\* How I approached the task \*\*

I started by sketching out an idea of how the flow and structure of the website should work and how the content would be presented. The aim was to create a simple but clear layout that works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

To build the project, I mainly used HTML and CSS. I used W3Schools for basic structure and syntax, and Gemini to help with media queries and some wrappers when the code started to feel messy. I also got help from a friend who provided feedback and support during the process. In addition, I followed the course syllabus to make sure the project met the assignment requirements.

\*\* If I had more time \*\*

If I had more time, I would have fully implemented the swipe functionality, allowing users to navigate between news articles using gestures. Due to time limitations, I had to lower my initial requirements and focus more on layout and content rather than advanced interactions.

The next step would also be to connect the website to a real API with news and organizations, so the content could update automatically instead of being static.
